        <p>My name is Tyler Mathews, I was born in January of 1990 and currently reside in Fraser, Colorado. I currently work as a patroller at Winter Park but decided to take the summer off to focus on this new career opportunity.
            I was born and raised in Marietta, Georgia (a suburb of Atlanta) and graduated from Kennesaw State University with a bachelors in history. I also played lacrosse through college and continue to coach at the high school level
            here in Fraser. In my freetime, sometimes it is hard to dedicate time to one hobby. I enjoy the outdoors so skiing, fishing, biking and hunting are at the top of the list but I also enjoy writing and playing music on string instruments
            and cranking up the Playstation for a chunk of time. Coding is quickly becoming another passion of mine that I look forward to exploring.</p>
        <p>I am currently a full stack web development student taking the course through the University of Denver.</p>
        <p>My dream is to make great software with great people.</p>
